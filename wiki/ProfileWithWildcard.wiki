= Grep Profiles with wildcard =

Usually, you associate one {{{Profile}}} with one specific file, but it's also possible to associate multiple files to the same {{{profile}}} using wildcard in the file path.

When grepping on a Profile with a wildcard, Grep4j will run an LS command first. It will then run separate greps and finally return a GrepResult for each file found in the LS.

== Example ==

{{{
//
Profile remoteProfile= new Profile("alogWithWildcard","/opt/jboss/server/default/log/server.log*");               
ServerDetails server = new ServerDetails("172.xx.xx.xx");     
uatFrontEndServer.setUser("user");
uatFrontEndServer.setPassword("password");
remoteProfile.setServerDetails(server);


}}}

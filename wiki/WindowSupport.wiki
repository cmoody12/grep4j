==Windows support==

At the moment we support Windows to remote Windows operations only through SSH server implementations like:

[http://sshwindows.sourceforge.net/ OpenSSH],       
[http://ist.uwaterloo.ca/~kscully/CygwinSSHD_W2K3.html CygwinSSH], 
[http://mobassh.mobatek.net/ MobaSSH]. 

`*` 
Windows to Unix or local Windows operations work just fine if you run the software via the bash console.

see the following [https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/mydeveloperworks/blogs/738b7897-cd38-4f24-9f05-48dd69116837/entry/programmatically_connecting_to_remote_systems2?lang=en IBM post] if you want to dig more into portability issue.


If you run a virtual Linux machine on your Windows you will not have problems.
